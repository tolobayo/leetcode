<h2 id="notes">📓 Repo Organization & Notes</h2>
I've grouped my solutions based on catagory. Each solution is in a file labeled by the problem name, so if you want to do the same one, you'll be able to find it by seacrching the file name on the platform.  
<br><br>
JavaScript is usually my language of choice, so you'll find most of my solutions are written in that language.<br><br>

Not every solution I've completed is in this repository, just ones I feel are worth saving. Checkout my profile on each platform for all the other ones Ive done!
